# Tic Tac Toe - React Version

## Description

I rebuilt the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React. This project was originally developed using Vanilla JavaScript, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/abdrrahim2002/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game). The goal of this project is to learn the basics of React. This game supports 2 players.


## Overview

Here are some snapshots of the game:
